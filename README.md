# Maazo Clinic (Python Clinic App)

A lightweight, single-file Python application to help manage basic clinic workflows.  
This repository currently contains the core application logic in `Maazo_clinic.py` and a `.gitignore`.  
This README is an enhanced template you can keep, trim, or adapt once you refine the app further.

## Overview

Maazo Clinic is intended as a simple clinic management console/script to experiment with:
- Patient intake
- Appointment scheduling
- Basic record handling
- (Optionally) billing or prescriptions

Because everything currently lives in a single Python file, it's ideal for learning or rapid prototyping. You can later modularize into packages (e.g. `patients/`, `appointments/`, `storage/`).


---

## Key Features

(Confirm and edit based on the actual code.)

- Add / list / update patient records
- Schedule and view appointments
- Simple in-memory or file-based storage
- Input-driven CLI menus
- Basic validation of user input
- Lightweight dependency footprint (core Python only)

---

## Tech Stack

- Language: Python 3.10+ (earlier versions may work; update after testing)
- Standard Library only (unless you add external dependencies)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python installed:  
  ```bash
  python --version
  ```
- (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
  .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows PowerShell
  ```

### Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HazratMaghaz/Python-Clinic-App.git
cd Python-Clinic-App
```

### Running the App
```bash
python Maazo_clinic.py
```

If the script uses a `main()` guard, it will launch an interactive menu. Otherwise, just follow on-screen prompts.

## Usage Examples

(Write concrete examples once you confirm functionality.)

Example session:
```
Welcome to Maazo Clinic
1. Register Patient
2. List Patients
3. Schedule Appointment
4. View Appointments
5. Exit
Select option: 1
Enter patient name: John Doe
Patient added with ID: P0001
```

## Project Structure

Current:
```

```

Future (proposed refactor):
```

  __init__.py
  models/
    patient.py
    appointment.py
  services/
    scheduler.py
    storage.py
  cli/
    menu.py
data/
  clinic_data.json
tests/
  test_patients.py
  test_appointments.py
```

---

## Data Persistence

If you're currently using in-memory structures (lists/dicts), data will not survive restarts.  
You can extend with one of these:
- JSON file (quick & simple)
- SQLite (`sqlite3` stdlib)
- TinyDB / SQLAlchemy (if adding dependencies)

Example JSON save pattern (add if not present):
```python
import json, os

def save_state(state, path="clinic_data.json"):
    with open(path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        json.dump(state, f, indent=2)

def load_state(path="clinic_data.json"):
    if not os.path.exists(path):
        return {}
    with open(path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        return json.load(f)
```

---

## Extending the Application

Ideas:
1. Authentication layer (e.g. staff login)
2. Patient search (by name, ID, partial match)
3. Appointment conflict detection
4. Export reports (CSV / PDF)
5. Basic billing/invoice system
6. REST API wrapper using FastAPI or Flask
7. Unit tests (Pytest + coverage)
8. Logging via `logging` module

---

## Roadmap

| Stage | Goal | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | Basic patient & appointment CRUD | In progress |
| 2 | Persistent storage (JSON/SQLite) | Planned |
| 3 | Input validation & error handling | Planned |
| 4 | Modularize code | Planned |
| 5 | Test suite & CI workflow | Planned |
| 6 | Optional GUI / Web API | Future |

Update as progress is made.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Fix |
|-------|----------------|-----|
| Unicode error | Terminal encoding | Run with UTF-8 locale |
| Data lost after restart | In-memory only | Implement persistence |
| Crash on invalid menu choice | Missing validation | Add `try/except` around casts |

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/new-thing`
3. Commit changes: `git commit -m "Add new feature"`
4. Push: `git push origin feature/new-thing`
5. Open a Pull Request

Coding style suggestions:
- Use type hints
- Keep functions < 40 lines where possible
- Add docstrings (Google or reST style)

## License

Add a license (MIT, Apache-2.0, etc.).  
Example (MIT):
```

```
Create a `LICENSE` file for clarity.
